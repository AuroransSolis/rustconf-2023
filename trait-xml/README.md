# ?????

So yes, in fact, I did choose XML because I know people hate it. Yes, in fact, this project was
created in no small part out of spite.

It was also in no small part because I thought it would be really funny.

So in theory, this should let you do just about anything you can do in a regular trait definition
(except meta items because this project is already way too big and I didn't really feel like adding
those in). See the top-level doc comment in `lib.rs` for info on how to use the macro, and if for
some silly reason you feel like calling any of the internal macros, you can do so as per the doc
comments on each of them.

Please do not try to find "practical" applications for this crate. I beg you.
Do not.
